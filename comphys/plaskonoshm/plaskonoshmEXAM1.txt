Prob 1: Output is correct, except that your calculation (at least for my
inputs) ends above the ground (y = 39.0) instead of when you get to a negative
value.  Congratulations that you did check to see if the initial y position 
is negative, and reprompt the user until s/he enters a positive value (!).  
Good job.  However, you did not close your output file.

Prob 2: The program produces the correct plot.  Note
that since it is guaranteed that all the data files would have the same
number of lines, you could have used a single while loop to read in the
data.  In addition, there is a serious problem with your code: the data 
files contain 101 points, but you allocate space for only 100 points, so 
you are actually writing data beyond the allocated space.  This can produce 
serious memory problems, and indeed the program ends in a segmentation fault.  
If that overwritten memory had been in a more dangerous location, the program 
would not have run and could even have crashed the computer.

Prob 3: The program runs and produces a reasonable result.  Problems with
the code: 1) You do not initialize ran1 in main.  2) You do not initialize
the counter N to 0, and so if there is some crap in that location in 
memory, you will get an invalid result.
