Prob 4.2: Program runs and gives correct answers.  The code does not give
the user a range of wavelengths to enter, nor does it check to see if the
value entered is between 3511 and 23254 A.  Apart from that, the code is ok.

                         88/100

Prob 4.3: Program runs and gives correct answers.  Your data vectors run
from 0 to 78, which is fine, but note that your for loop:

	for(i = 0 ; i < 79 ; i++) 
	{
		if(pressureArray[i] < pressure && pressureArray[i + 1] >= pressure)

could potentially access pressureArray[79], which does not exist. As a 
matter of fact, this will not happen, as the user would have to supply 
P > 2150, but it is not a good idea to have code with a potential memory 
problem like that.

Prob 4.4: Your program runs and gives very nearly the correct answers.  I
think the main reason for the discrepancy is your inaccurate value for pi:
const double pi = 3.14159; the code otherwise looks ok.

Prob 4.5: Program runs and gives correct answers.  The code does not give
the user a range of wavelengths to enter, nor does it check to see if the
value entered is between 3511 and 23254 A.  Apart from that, the code is ok.
(Same comment as 4.2).

Prob 4.8: Your program runs, and gives the right answers.  Some problems
with the code: 1) Again, please remember to prompt the user with the range
of valid values, 2) The problem stipulated that you should prompt the
user for Ne, not logNe.  Otherwise the code looks ok.
