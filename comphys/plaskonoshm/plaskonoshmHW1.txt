Prob 1.2: The program compiles and gives correct answers. However, you declared
all of your variables as external.  There is no reason to do this.  Those
variable declarations:

int ni;
float vIni;
float vFin;
float tFin;

should be inside of main().  The code otherwise is fine.

Prob 1.3: The program compiles and gives correct answers, however the formating
of the output is a bit awkward.  
r(hat) = 0.00000000009396926208 
theta(hat) = 0.00000000001710100717
It would be better to use %e format code to print these out in scientific
notation:
9.396926e-11
1.710101e-11
Other comments:
1) When you define a constant, please do not do it with arithmetical expressions.  Thus,
const double mu0 = 3.141592653589793 * 4.0 * 0.0000001;
should be
const double mu0 = 1.256637061e-06;

Prob 1.5: The program compiles, runs, and gives correct answers.  Code looks
fine.

                         100/100


Prob 1.7: The program compiles, runs, and gives correct answers.  Code looks
fine.  However, since you are asking the user to enter r in meters, you might
want to use the formating code %le in order to accept scientific notation, or
%lg which can accept both.

Prob 2.1: The program compiles and runs, but produces incorrect answers.
You are using the wrong equation:

v -= 9.8*t

is not equivalent to

v = v0 - 9.8*t

Why?  Because in the latter, v0 is a constant, in the former, it is changing.
So, your equation is equivalent to:

v = v - 9.8*t

Prob 2.3: The program compiles and runs but gives incorrect values for y. This
is because you used t^2 in your calculation of y instead of t^3.  Otherwise
the code looks ok.

                          95/100 

Prob 2.4: The program compiles and runs but gives incorrect values for y. This
is because you used t^2 in your calculation of y instead of t^3.  However, 
there is a philosophical problem with using a double as the variable in the 
for loop. While this does work, what you have essentially done is to convert 
a for loop into a while loop.  For loops should be used with integer variables.
Please see example in the lecture notes.
