Prob 1: Your code runs but seems to be stuck in an infinite loop.  So, you do
everything in your "walk" function.  I wanted you to write a walk function that
would return the position after a single 100-step random walk.  But you carry
out the 100000 random walks within walk itself.  Looking at that function,
the problem is that you use x, the position after the 100-step random walk as
the index for bin.  It is entirely possible that x could exceed 80 in which case
you would be writing to memory not allocated.  That would give a segmentation
fault, or cause your program to hang.

Prob 2: Your code runs and outputs the correct results.  The code looks fine
except that line 61 is a stray, and is left over from the key.  However, it
did no harm!!

Prob 3: The program did not compile and returned with 3 errors.  These arise
from a single extra parentheses on line 81.  Correcting that and recompiling,
your program now produces correct coefficients but the errors are incorrect.
Your chi2 value is incorrect.  The reason for this is that you are not
summing over all the data values but only i = 1 to m.  So your chi2 is much
too small.
