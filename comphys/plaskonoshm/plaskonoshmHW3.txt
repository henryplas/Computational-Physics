Prob 3.4: Program runs, but does not stop.  Infinite loop?  Looks like the
problem comes from:

int main(int argc, char const *argv[])

argv cannot be declared const, because then it cannot be modified.  Removing
the const, it still does not run.  2) You left out a print statement in
if (argc != 2) 
        {
            ("\nEnter the tolerance (scientific notation, e.g. 1.5e-13) > ");
            ni = scanf("%le",&tolerance);
        }
so the user is never prompted.  Adding that print statement,
the program now works and gives correct answers.

Prob 3.5: Looks good.

Prob 3.7: Looks good.

                        100/100

Prob 3.8: Not certain why you are using a while loop (beginning line 54)?
In addition, the stop condition:
wave[j] != 0.0
is dangerous because you are relying on an uninitiated space in memory to be
0, whereas it may not be.

Prob 3.9: Your calculations for the Eemian and Illinoian are not correct.
Not certain why you initialized m and n to 1.  You should cast like:
sum0/(double)m    and
sum1/(double)n

because it is only m and n that are integers.  Casting the quantities
sum0/m sum1/n doesn't do any good because the mathematics has already been
done before the cast.
