Prob 7.11: program runs and gives correct answers.  Because your area of
integration is a rectangle, and you are generating random points to fall inside
that rectangle, you don't actually have to test whether they fall inside.  So
that part of the code can be removed.

Prob 7.12: The program prints out correct values for X and Y, but no errors.
It does not print out a value for M.  Some comments on the code: 1) You are
taking the entire rectangle as V, so V should be 2, not 1.  2) You do 
calculate M but don't print it out.  3) No errors are calculated.

Prob 7.14: Your program runs and outputs reasonable results, although my
program goes to lower energies (-94) than yours and does it more quickly.
You need to initialize energy "e" to 0 in the energy function.  Otherwise
your code looks reasonable.

Prob 8.2: Does not prompt the user for a step size, but uses dx = 0.0000001; !
I am too impatient to wait for it to stop, so I edited your code to make
dx = 0.1 and recompiled. It then produces the expected result.

Prob 8.3: Looks good!   100/100

Prob 8.4: Hmm, the program runs and gets to x = 1.0, but the step sizes are
too big and the final result is not at all accurate (should be 0.666666).
Problems with the code: 1) You set initial dx = 0.1, but then for the double
step you use dx = 0.1, and for the single step 0.05.  It should have been
0.2 and 0.1.  2) Since your single step is 0.05, your step size adjustment
(next statement) is not correct, as that is for the correct single step of
0.1.  Note: this code looks awfully like that of dornja.
