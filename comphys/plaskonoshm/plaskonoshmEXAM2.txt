Prob 1: The program runs and outputs correct results.  However, you do not
reprompt if the user enters numbers which are outside of the limits.  Please
also pay attention to indentation so that your indentation is consistent.
Otherwise, your program looks fine.

Prob 2: The program runs and outputs correct results.  However, you do
use a and b before they are initialized.  In addition, your brackets are
pretty large (0 and 100).  By examining the function using gnuplot you could
have reduced that upper limit by quite a bit.

Prob 3: You get the big oscillation nearly correct, but not the small
oscillation.  That is because you used the same amplitude and period for
the two oscillations.  The problem with that is that powell is not able to
choose which one to fit to the big oscillation and which to fit to the small.
It just tries to fit both to the big.  So, you should have used quite
different values for A2 and P2.
